# Bakery
In this project, I created a landing page for a bakery shop using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The landing page features a clean and modern design that showcases the bakery's delicious offerings and inviting atmosphere.
Using HTML, I structured the content of the page into different sections, such as a header, a main content area, and a footer. I also included various HTML tags to format the text and add images to the page.
To make the page visually appealing, I used CSS to apply styles such as colors, fonts, and layouts to the HTML elements. I also made the page responsive using Bootstrap's built-in responsive design classes, which allow the page to adjust its layout and design to fit different screen sizes and devices.
Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to create a visually appealing and functional landing page using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
